# Switching Perspectives

D2D is one of many available CAVE perspectives.  By selecting the **CAVE** > **Perspective** menu you can switch into the **GFE**, **Hydro**, **Localization**, **MPE**, or **National Centers Perspective** (which is available in the **Other...** submenu. Nobody seems to know why the NCP is not listed with the other perspectives, or how to make it appear with them).
