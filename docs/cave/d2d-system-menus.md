# Import / Export

**File > Import**

Import GIS Data, BCD File, GeoTIFF, LPI File, Shapefile, SPI File, or a D2D Display. The "GIS Data" option opens the GIS application, which provides the ability to import geospatial data from varying GIS data sources. The GIS application has been incorporated into CAVE for use with FX-Net.

**File > Export > Image**

**File > Export > Print Screen**

will bring up the workstation print dialog.

**File > Export > KML**

The displays can then be used in other applications or sent to other users for analysis. The "Export" submenu also includes a "KML" option, which allows users to save D2D displays in the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file format (actually as a compressed KMZ), which can be used in applications such as Google Earth.

The KML dialog box includes options to select frames to export, as well as the following "Other Options":

* **Export Hidden**: When selected, all displayed and hidden products listed in the Product Legend section of the Main Display Pane will be exported.

* **Export Maps**: When selected, all enabled maps displayed within the Main Display Pane will be
exported.

* **Shade Earth**: When selected, a shaded background is applied to the exported product. If loaded in Google Earth, the earth will be overlaid with a black backdrop, and data will be displayed as it would in D2D with a black background.

* **Show Background Tiles**: When selected, data (such as plot data) will display on top of black
tiles when loaded in Google Earth.
