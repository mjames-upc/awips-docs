We call the DOM that an element is in charge of creating and managing its _local
DOM_. This is distinct from the element's children which are sometimes called
its _light DOM_ for clarity.

{{site.project_title}} supports multiple local DOM implementations. On browsers
that support shadow DOM, shadow DOM may be used to create local DOM. On other
supported browsers, {{site.project_title}} provides local DOM via a custom
implementation called _shady DOM_ which is inspired by shadow DOM.

Shady DOM requires you to use the [{{site.project_title}} DOM API](#dom-api) when manipulating DOM from JavaScript. This interface covers most of the common DOM methods and properties, and is compatible with both shady DOM and native shadow DOM. 

**Note:** 
Currently {{site.project_title}} uses shady DOM by default on all browsers.
To opt-in to using shadow DOM where available, see [Global settings](settings.html)

## Local DOM template {#template-stamping}

To specify DOM to use for an element's local DOM, use the `<dom-module>` element.
Give the `<dom-module>` an `id` attribute that matches its element's
`is` property and put a `<template>` inside the `<dom-module>`.
Polymer will automatically clone this template's contents into the element's local DOM.

Example:

    <dom-module id="x-foo">

      <template>I am x-foo!</template>

      <script>
        Polymer({
          is: 'x-foo'
        });
      </script>

    </dom-module>



We say that an element definition has an imperative and declarative portion. The imperative
portion is the call to `Polymer({...})`, and the declarative portion is the `<dom-module>`
element. The imperative and declarative portions of an element's definition may be placed
in the same html file or in separate files.

The `<script>` tag can be inside or outside of the `<dom-module>` element.

The elementâ€™s template must be parsed before the call to Polymer.

**Note:** Elements should generally be defined outside of the main document, except for 
testing. For caveats about defining elements in the main document, see 
[main document definitions](registering-elements.html#main-document-definitions).
{: .alert .alert-info }


## Automatic node finding {#node-finding}

{{site.project_title}} automatically builds a map of statically created instance nodes 
in  its local DOM, to provide convenient access to frequently used nodes without
the need to query for them manually.  Any node specified in the
element's template with an `id` is stored on the `this.$` hash by `id`.

**Note:** Nodes created dynamically using data binding (including those in 
`dom-repeat` and `dom-if` templates) are _not_ added to the
`this.$` hash. The hash includes only _statically_ created local DOM nodes
(that is, the nodes defined in the element's outermost template).
{: .alert .alert-warning }


Example:

    <dom-module id="x-custom">

      <template>
        Hello World from <span id="name"></span>!
      </template>

      <script>

        Polymer({

          is: 'x-custom',

          ready: function() {
            this.$.name.textContent = this.tagName;
          }

        });

      </script>

    </dom-module>

  

For locating dynamically-created nodes in your element's local DOM, use the `$$` 
method:

<code>this.$$(<var>selector</var>)</code>

`$$` returns the first node in the local DOM that matches <code><var>selector</var></code>.

## DOM distribution {#dom-distribution}

To support composition of an element's light DOM with its local DOM, Polymer
supports the `<content>` element. The `<content>` element provides an insertion
point at which an element's light DOM is combined with its local DOM. The
`<content>` element supports a `select` attribute which filters nodes via a
simple selector.

Example:

    <template>
      <header>Local dom header followed by distributed dom.</header>
      <content select=".content"></content>
      <footer>Footer after distributed dom.</footer>
    </template>

In shadow DOM, the browser maintains separate light DOM and shadow DOM trees, and creates a 
merged view (the _composed tree_) for rendering purposes.

In shady DOM, {{site.project_title}} maintains its own light DOM and shady DOM trees.
The document's DOM tree is effectively the composed tree. 

## DOM API {#dom-api}

Polymer provides a custom API for manipulating DOM such that local DOM and light DOM trees are properly maintained. 

**Note:** All DOM manipulation must use this API, as opposed to DOM API directly on nodes.
{: .alert .alert-error }

These methods and properties have the same signatures as their standard DOM equivalents, with the following exceptions:

*   **`Array` not `NodeList`**. Properties and methods that return a list 
    of nodes return an `Array`, not a `NodeList`.

*   **Local DOM root**. Use the `root` property to access a 
    {{site.project_title}} element's local DOM root &mdash; equivalent to 
    the shadow root in native shadow DOM.

*   **Async operations.** Insert, append, and remove operations are 
    transacted lazily in certain cases for performance.  In order to 
    interrogate the DOM (for example, `offsetHeight`, `getComputedStyle`, etc.) immediately after one of these operations, call `Polymer.dom.flush()` first.

The following methods and properties are provided.

Adding and removing children:

*   `Polymer.dom(parent).appendChild(node)`
*   `Polymer.dom(parent).insertBefore(node, beforeNode)`
*   `Polymer.dom(parent).removeChild(node)`
*   `Polymer.dom.flush()`

Calling `append`/`insertBefore` adds the node to <var>parent</var>'s _light DOM_.  In order to insert/append into the local DOM of a custom element, use a node in the local DOM as a parent (or `this.root`, which is the root of the local DOM).

Parent and child APIs:
 
  * `Polymer.dom(parent).childNodes`
  * `Polymer.dom(parent).children`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).parentNode`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).firstChild`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).lastChild`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).firstElementChild`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).lastElementChild`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).previousSibling`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).nextSibling`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).textContent`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).innerHTML`

**Note: When working with light DOM children, you may want to consider 
using the distributed children or effective children APIs. 
See [Work with light DOM children](#light-dom-children) for details.
{: .alert .alert-info }

Query selector:

  * `Polymer.dom(parent).querySelector(selector)`
  * `Polymer.dom(parent).querySelectorAll(selector)`

Content APIs:

  * `Polymer.dom(contentElement).getDistributedNodes()`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).getDestinationInsertionPoints()`

Node mutation APIs:

  * `Polymer.dom(node).setAttribute(attribute, value)`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).removeAttribute(attribute)`
  * `Polymer.dom(node).classList`

Using these node mutation APIs when manipulating children ensures that shady
DOM can distribute content elements dynamically. If you change attributes or
classes that could affect distribution **without** using the `Polymer.dom`
API, call `distributeContent` on the host element to force it to update its
distribution.

### Work with local DOM

Every {{site.project_title}} element has a `this.root` property which is the
root of its local DOM tree. You can manipulate the tree using `Polymer.dom` methods:

    // Append to local DOM
    var toLocal = document.createElement('div');
    Polymer.dom(this.root).appendChild(toLocal);

    // Insert to the local DOM
    var toInsert = document.createElement('div');
    var beforeNode = Polymer.dom(this.root).childNodes[0];
    Polymer.dom(this.root).insertBefore(toLocal, beforeNode);

You can use the [automatic node finding](#node-finding) feature to locate local DOM nodes:

    var item = document.createElement('li');
    Polymer.dom(this.$.list).appendChild(item);

You can also locate nodes in the local DOM using `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, or the `$$` utility method:

    var cancelButton = Polymer.dom(this.root).querySelector('#cancelButton');

    // Shorthand for finding local DOM children by ID
    // (equivalent to the above):
    this.$$('cancelButton');

### Work with light DOM children {#light-dom-children}

When creating a custom element that can take light DOM children, you 
frequently need to interact with  your child nodes imperatively. 

An element can access its light DOM children using `Polymer.dom(this).children` and similar properties and methods. However, most of the time you want to be aware of how light DOM children are distributed to insertion points.

If your element has local DOM and contains one or more insertion points 
(`<content>` tags), you can query the set of [_distributed child nodes_](#distributed-children) that are being distributed to a given insertion point.

In some cases, distributed nodes might not be what you want. For example:

*   Your element has no shadow DOM.
*   You're interested in elements that **aren't** being distributed into 
    any insertion point.
*   You want to see all of your child nodes, regardless of what insertion 
    point they've been distributed to.

In these cases, you simply want a list of the element's children. The [_effective children_ APIs](#effective-children) are a useful way of accessing light DOM children regardless of whether they're being distributed to insertion points in your element.

#### Distributed children {#distributed-children}

Sometimes it's necessary to access the elements which have been distributed to a given `<content>` insertion point or to know to which `<content>` a given node has been distributed. The `getDistributedNodes` and `getDestinationInsertionPoints` methods, respectively, provide this information:


    <x-foo>
      <div></div>
    </x-foo>

    <!-- x-foo's template -->
    <template>
      <content></content>
    </template>

    // script
    var lightDomDiv = Polymer.dom(xFoo).querySelector('div');
    var insertionPoint = Polymer.dom(xFoo.root).querySelector('content');
    var distributed = Polymer.dom(insertionPoint).getDistributedNodes()[0];
    var insertedTo = Polymer.dom(lightDomDiv).getDestinationInsertionPoints()[0];

    // the following should be true:
    console.log(distributed === lightDomDiv);
    console.log(insertedTo === insertionPoint);

Note that `getDistributedNodes` only returns useful results when called on a
`<content>` element, and `getDestinationInsertionPoints` only returns useful
results when called on an element that's being distributed.

Because retrieving the children of a given content tag is a common pattern,
the element API includes `getContentChildNodes` and `getContentChildren`
utility methods. Both methods take a CSS selector that identifies a
`<content>` element in the element's local DOM. (If the selector is omitted,
both methods default to the first `<content>` element in the local DOM.)

    <dom-module id="simple-content">
      <template>
        <content id="myContent"></content>
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer({
          is: 'simple-content',
          ready: function() {
            var distributed = this.getContentChildren('#myContent');
            console.log(distributed.length);
          }
        });
      </script>
    </dom-module>


#### Effective children {#effective-children}

Effective children are the  set of an element's light DOM children, _with 
any insertion points replaced by their distributed children._

Consider a simple image carousel element with no local DOM. It's used like this:

    <simple-carousel>
      <img src="one.jpg">
      <img src="two.jpg">
      <img src="three.jpg">
    <simple-carousel>

The carousel adds dots underneath the current image that let the user select 
a different image, so the carousel needs to know how many children it has. 
This is simple enough: the carousel can check its children in the `attached` 
callback:

    attached: function() {
      this.childCount = Polymer.dom(this).children.length;
      // do something with childCount ...
    }

But there are a few issues here. What if you create a new element, 
`<popup-carousel>`, that includes a simple carousel in its local DOM? You 
use the new element the same way:

    <popup-carousel>
      <img src="one.jpg">
      <img src="two.jpg">
    </popup-carousel>

Internally, the popup-carousel does something like this:

    <dom-module id="popup-carousel">
      <template>
        <simple-carousel>
          <content></content>
        </simple-carousel>
      </template>
      ...
    </dom-module>

The popup carousel simply passes its children on to the simple carousel by 
including a `<content>` tag. But now the simple carousel's `attached` method 
doesn't work: `Polymer.dom(this).children.length` will always return 1, 
because the carousel only has a single child, the `<content>` tag. 

Clearly, `children` isn't what you want here. You want a list of children, 
with any `<content>` tags replaced by their distributed children. 
Unfortunately, the platform doesn't have a primitive for this, so Polymer 
has added the concept of "effective children" in its DOM API.

You can retrieve an element's effective child nodes using:

    var effectiveChildren = Polymer.dom(element).getEffectiveChildNodes();

For convenience, several utility methods are available on the Polymer 
element prototype:

*   `getEffeciveChildNodes()`. Returns a list of effective child nodes for 
    this element.
*   `getEffectiveChildren()`. Returns a list of effective child elements for
    this element.
*   `queryEffectiveChildren(selector)`. Returns the first effective child 
    that matches <var>selector</var>. 
*   `queryAllEffectiveChildren(selector)`. Returns a list of effective
    children that match <var>selector</var>.

Replacing `children` with the `getEffectiveChildren` method gives you the 
result you want:

    this.childCount = this.getEffectiveChildren().length;

You can think of `getEffectiveChildren` as a composition-friendly version of 
`children`.

### Observe added and removed children {#observe-nodes}

Use the DOM API's `observeNodes` method to track when children are added and 
removed from
your element:

    this._observer = Polymer.dom(this.$.contentNode).observeNodes(function(info) {
      this.processNewNodes(info.addedNodes);
      this.processRemovedNodes(info.removedNodes);
    });

You pass `observeNodes` a callback to be invoked when nodes are added or 
removed. The callback takes a single Object argument, with `addedNodes` and 
`removedNodes` arrays. 

The method returns a handle that can be used to stop observation:

    Polymer.dom(node).unobserveNodes(this._observer);

The `observeNodes` method behaves slightly differently depending on the 
node being observed:

*   If the node being observed is a _content node_, the callback is called
    when the content node's _distributed children_ change.
*   For any other node, the callback is called when the node's [_effective
    children_](#effective-children) change. 

A few notes on `observeNodes`:

*   Since the method is attached to the DOM API, the callback is called the 
    observed node as the `this` value. So if you do:

        this._observer = Polymer.dom(this.$.content).observeNodes(_childrenChanged);

    The callback is invoked with `this.$.content` as the `this` value. If you want to use the custom element as the `this` value, you need to bind the callback:

      var boundHandler = this._childNodesChanged.bind(this);
      this._observer = Polymer.dom(this.$.content).observeNodes(boundHandler);

*   The callback argument lists added and removed nodes, not just elements. 
    If you're only interested in elements, you can filter the node list:

        info.addedNodes.filter(function(node) {
          return (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
        });

*   The first callback from `observeNodes` contains **all** nodes added 
    to the element, _not_ the elements added since `observeNodes` was 
    called. This works well if you're using `observeNodes` exclusively.

    If you need to synchronously process the element's children -- for 
    example, in `attached`, and then use `observeNodes` to monitor changes 
    to the child list, you may need to be aware of this. 


#### Why not just a mutation observer?

If you're familiar with mutation observers, you may wonder why you can't just use a mutation observer to handle DOM changes.

For the simple case, you can use a mutation observer to detect when children are added or removed from your element. However, mutation observers have the same limitation as the `children` list: they don't reflect local DOM distributions. In the case of the `<popup-carousel>` example, adding a child to `<popup-carousel>` wouldn't trigger a mutation observer on `<simple-carousel>`. 

To detect those changes, `<simple-carousel>` would have to check its child list for `<content>` nodes. If it's got a `<content>` node in its `children`, it would need to add _another_ mutation observer on its shadow host (in this case, `<popup-carousel>`). And so on. Suddenly, the `<simple-carousel>` isn't so simple anymore. 

The `observeNodes` method handles this complexity for you. It uses mutation observers internally to track DOM changes, and handles the extra bookkeeping required to track local DOM distributions. 
Unlike a mutation observer, the `observeNodes` callback is only invoked when nodes are added or removed &mdash; it doesn't handle attribute changes or character data changes.

### DOM API examples 

Some examples of using the `Polymer.dom`.

Add a child to the light DOM:

    var toLight = document.createElement('div');
    Polymer.dom(this).appendChild(toLight);

Retrieve all `<span>` elements in the light DOM.

    var allSpans = this.queryAllEffectiveChildren('span');

You can use `Polymer.dom` on any node, whether or not it has a local DOM tree:

    <template>
      <div id="container">
         <div id="first"></div>
         <content></content>
      </div>
    </template>

    ...

    var insert = document.createElement('div');
    Polymer.dom(this.$.container).insertBefore(insert, this.$.first);
