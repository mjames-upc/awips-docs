title: Start EDEX Manually

All EDEX services are started and stopped with the commands `edex start` and `edex stop`, and individual services can be started in the following order

    service edex_postgres start
    service httpd-pypies start
    service qpidd start
    service edex_camel start
    service edex_ldm start
    
Services can be stopped in reverse order

    service edex_ldm stop
    service edex_camel stop
    service qpidd stop
    service httpd-pypies stop
    service edex_postgres stop

The service config files are located in `/etc/init.d/`:


    ls -la /etc/init.d/ |grep -e edex -e pypies -e qpid
